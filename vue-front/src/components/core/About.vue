                         Welcome to Classic Gravy. 
                        this blog has been the place for me to share the edible inspirations from my playtime in the kitchen, and my deep love for whole foods. The recipes and ideas you’ll find here revolve around my plant-based way of eating, and I hope that through the simple and delicious dishes I create, you too will discover a whole new world of flavour and nourishment.

                WHY DID YOU START Classic Gravy?
            </v-card-title>
            <v-card-text class="styleTwo">
                I started this blog because I wanted to share the incredible knowledge I had received through my education in Holistic Nutrition. I discovered so many things that I believed needed to be public information, not just for those who can go to school to study in this field. I wanted to set up a non-biased space for people to come and learn about how to take better care of themselves through diet and lifestyle, as I have seen immense changes in myself since making little, positive changes every day.

            <v-card-text class="styleTwo">
                I was so tired of being bombarded by self-interested media and half-truths about how to look after myself, and I knew I wasn’t alone. Since my education was almost like a user-guide for my body, mind, and spirit, I thought it was time to spread the word! When I discover something new I am simply too excited not to share! We’re all in this together – let’s help each other be the best we can be! (Yes, I was probably a cheerleader in a past life).

                WHAT IS YOUR EDUCATION?
            </v-card-title>
            <v-card-text class="styleTwo">
                I am a Holistic Nutritionist and Certified Nutritional Practitioner (CNP). To obtain this accreditation, I attended the Institute of Holistic Nutrition in Toronto, Canada. IHN is a private college that offers an intensive 1 year full-time or 2 year part-time program based on a university-level curriculum with locations in Ontario and British Columbia, Canada.
Students graduate with a diploma in Applied Holistic Nutrition and have earned the designation of Certified Nutritional Practitioner (CNP), with full qualification to receive the Registered Nutritional Consultant Practitioner (RNCP) and Registered Orthomolecular Health Practitioner (ROHP) designations.

            <v-card-text class="styleTwo">
               I really loved this school because of its incredibly diversified curriculum, and the education I received gave me a great springboard to continue in my own way. You do need to be certified to practice legally as a Certified Nutritional Practitioner (not a dietitian, as you may know). A word of caution: you will not be recognized by the medical community with this designation, so if a private practice is what you’re looking for, go for it. Even if you just want the information for yourself, it is truly the best year of education you’ll receive about your body, mind, and how to take care of yourself in a holistic, natural way.

            <v-card-text class="styleTwo">
                Since I lived in Canada at the time I took my education, I really don’t know anything about the schools in other countries. You’ll have to look up CNP certification programs if you live elsewhere.

                WHAT EXACTLY IS HOLISTIC NUTRITION?
            </v-card-title>
            <v-card-text class="styleTwo">
                The best way to define Holistic Nutrition is a health care system based on integrating the physical, nutritional, environmental, emotional and spiritual components of someone’s life. It emphasizes personal responsibility and a cooperative relationship between practitioner and client. Working with both the diet and lifestyle, I help people return to a state of healthy balance and well-being.

                WHY DID YOU START COOKING?
            </v-card-title>
            <v-card-text class="styleTwo">
                When I moved from Toronto to Copenhagen I found out that I couldn’t legally practice, so I wrote a list of the jobs I really wanted to do instead. Without thinking about practicalities or what was “realistic”, the one thing that kept coming up was cooking. What?! “I am not a cook”, I kept saying to myself. “I have no formal training, no experience besides making food for myself and developing recipes for Classic Gravy, so how in the world can I expect a restaurant to hire me based on the fact that I like to fool around in the kitchen?” I finally got sick of doubting myself, realized it was clearly what I wanted to do, so I pulled up my socks and headed out to every single veggie-friendly restaurant in the city.
Well, sure enough, someone took a chance on Sarah B. In my interviews I just let my honest passion for food and learning shine through, so of course I got the gig. Of course.

               HOW DID YOU LEARN HOW TO COOK?

            <v-card-text class="styleTwo">
                I taught myself. See answer above

                WHAT IS YOUR FOOD PHILOSOPHY? 
            </v-card-title>
            <v-card-text class="styleTwo">
                A lot of people want to know “what I am” – vegetarian, vegan, raw foodist, fruitarian, macrobiotic…guess what? I am a person who eats!
My food philosophy is this: I don’t like labels. They force a person to define themselves with very rigid terms, and beat themselves up if they suddenly eat something that doesn’t fit that definition. I know I never want to have to label what “kind” of diet I subscribe to. Being dogmatic about anything, for me, just doesn’t work. Being flexible does.
            </v-card-text>
            <v-card-text class="styleTwo">
                I eat almost entirely organic food. My diet consists mainly (like, 99%) of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans, lentils, nuts, and seeds. I probably eat an egg once every couple weeks if the mood strikes me, and sometimes I will enjoy some goat or sheep dairy in very small amounts. You’ll even catch me nibbling on a freshly caught fish once or twice a year at our summerhouse (if I know where it came from, who caught it, and that it was killed humanely, I’m game. Why not? There is nothing like a fish straight out of the ocean!)
